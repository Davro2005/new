## What Is JavaScript?
JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that offers cross-platform functionality and is primarily used for creating interactive web pages. A few everyday use cases for JavaScript include creating clickable buttons, complex animations, and pop-up menus.

## why we use JavaScript?

Advanced server-side JavaScript versions like Node.js enable users to boost website functionality with features such as real-time collaboration. Inside web browsers and other host environments, JavaScript offers connectivity among objects, enabling users to exercise programmatic control over them.



## HYSTORY

Like Java, JavaScript’s origins lie in the early days of the world wide web. As the world increasingly gained internet access in the 1990s, technology pioneers raced to build a robust, efficient internet browser. Two major companies, Microsoft and Netscape, wanted to push out Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, intending to dominate the web browser market.

To win this ‘browser war’, Netscape was looking for a lightweight scripting language to make programming easier and remove the need for in-depth programming knowledge among employees. It was in 1995 that Brendan Eich, a Netscape team member, took on the challenge of building such a language within ten days. He created Mocha, the predecessor to JavaScript.

Once AOL acquired Netscape and the Mozilla Foundation gained access to Netscape Navigator’s source code, JavaScript grew in popularity. Today, this critical web technology is a key component of most popular web browsers. Web developers generally include JavaScript in their stack; the Stack Overflow Developer Survey constantly pegs JavaScript as one of the most commonly used languages among programmers.


How exactly is JavaScript related to Java? While both are popular programming languages with a host of commonalities, the reason for the similarity in their names is nothing more than simple marketing. The main reason Mocha’s name was changed to JavaScript was to gain from the exploding popularity of Java at its peak.

But be it for this reason or due to its robust functionality, this scripting language put together by one person in just 10 days has today become a favorite of the world wide web. JavaScript’s success also stemmed from the fact that it transformed web browsers into application platforms. It did so through its useability in both back-end and front-end web development.



## ADVATAGIES

Other advantages of JavaScript include the fact that it is standardized, allowing for frequent updates and its compatibility with the document object model (DOM) for responding to user interactions. It is still the preferred tool for giving websites interactivity functions such as object movement and scroll transitions. Modern browsers still strive to enhance the user experience by processing JavaScript as swiftly as possible.

Additionally, JavaScript users can access numerous libraries and frameworks for developing complex applications without heavy resource use. Importing these frameworks and libraries into code allows programmers to bolster their applications.

Apart from offering numerous possibilities to programmers, JavaScript is the only browser-native programming language and has a low barrier to entry. This, combined with the other reasons we’ll discuss below, make it one of the world’s favorite scripting languages.
